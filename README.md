# TS design-patterns 
### Creational patterns
**These patterns are responsible for the convenient and safe creation of new objects or even entire families of objects**
1. [Constructor](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/CreationalPatterns/Constructor.js) - creating new objects
2. [Prototype](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/CreationalPatterns/Prototype.ts) - creating clone of objects contains prototype
3. [Factory](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/CreationalPatterns/Factory.js) - creating objects from different instances
4. [Singleton](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/CreationalPatterns/Singleton.ts) - prevent creating equal object from different parts of app
5. [Builder](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/CreationalPatterns/Builder.ts) - multistep creation complex objects

### Structral patterns
**These patterns are responsible for building easy maintain class hierarchies**
1. [Adapter](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/StructuralPatterns/Adapter.js) - use interface with old objects
1. [Bridge](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/StructuralPatterns/Bridge.js) - divide objects at two independent kind
