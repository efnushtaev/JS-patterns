# TS design-patterns 
### Creational patterns
**These patterns are responsible for the convenient and safe creation of new objects or even entire families of objects**
1. [Prototype](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Creational/Prototype.ts) - creating clone of objects contains prototype
2. [FactoryMethod](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Creational/FactoryMethod.ts) - creating objects from different instances
3. [Singleton](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Creational/Singleton.ts) - prevent creating equal object from different parts of app
4. [Builder](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Creational/Builder.ts) - multistep creation complex objects
5. [AbstractFactory](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Creational/AbstractFactory.ts) - implementing family of products

### Structral patterns
**These patterns are responsible for building easy maintain class hierarchies**
1. [Adapter](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Structural/Adapter.ts) - use interface with old objects
2. [Bridge](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Structural/Bridge.ts) - divide objects at two independent kind
3. [Composite](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Structural/Composite.ts) - creating tree-structure
4. [Decorator](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Structural/Decorator.ts) - add function-wrapper for new funcionality
5. [Facade](https://github.com/efnushtaev/JS-patterns/blob/main/Structural/Facade.ts) - creating simple interface for complex structure
